- 👋 Hi, I’m Min-Jae Kwon. You can call me MJ.
- 👀 I want to be a good researcher in RL. I’m interested in Machine Learning especially, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Meta Learning.  

  My main interests in RL lie on eXplainable RL (XRL), generalizations in RL, Meta RL and RL for finance. Actually, I started to learn XRL this December and found it is very interesting. Generalisation in RL is also an interesting topic I faced while studying RL for finance. 

  I was majored in Mathematics and had studied Mathematics for almost 8 years (Undergraduate, Graduate) before I started to learn Machine Learning from late 2019. I have a strong mathmatical background. The courses I took include Linear Algebra, Analysis, Complex Analysis, Probability, Measure Theory, Abstract Algebra, Graph Theory, Differential Geometry, Differential Equations, Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics and extra. 
  
  I finished basic concepts of Machine Learning through books like Bishop: Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Ian Goodfellow et al: Deep Learning, Sutton & Barto: Reinforcement Learning, and Géron, Aurélien: Hands on Machine Learning. 
  
  In terms of RL, I have been reading classic papers by Degris, Sutton, Munos, Abbeel, Haarnoja, Levine, Schulman, Precup, Kakade, Tsitsiklis, Conda and extra. 
  
  I learned and implemented famous RL algorithm like PPO, DQN, DDQN, TD3, Vanilla, and Actor-Critic based methods, experimenting with Atari, Mujoco Enviroments and Custom environments (mainly for stock market applications) as well.

- 🌱 I’m currently doing research about Reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization in University of Toronto as a visiting researcher.
